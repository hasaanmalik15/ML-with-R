<h2>Machine Learning Project with R Programming</h2>

This project is all about using R programming and relevant libraries to apply machine learning algorithms to solve problems and analyze data. Here's a brief overview of what's done in the project:

In this project, I used R programming to develop and evaluate machine learning models. I focused on the following key algorithms:

Linear Regression: Used linear regression to predict numeric outcomes based on predictor variables. Auto dataset was used that is included in the “ISLR” package.

Decision Tree: Decision tree algorithm was employed to make predictions based on the features. The room occupancy dataset was used for the model development. 


Random Forest: Random forest algorithm was used , which is an ensemble of decision tree. This can be great for reducing overfitting and enhancing predictions. The room occupancy dataset was used for the model development. 

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used with linear/radical kernal with corresponding optimal paramters. Both models were also evaluated with ROC curve analysis. SVM algorithm helps in finding the best way to separate data into different classes. The wine quality dataset was used for the model developmemt. 

On a whole, the project is all about developing and evaluating the different ML models on different datasets using R and libraries like "ISLR", "randomforest", "tree", "e1071", "caret", "ROCR"
